#+title: Benchmark

The single-threaded and multi-threaded variants of KangarooTwelve from this
package are compared against:
+ =crc32c= from the =CRC32c= standard library
+ =sha256sum= from the =SHA= standard library
+ =md5= from [[https://github.com/JuliaCrypto/MD5.jl][MD5.jl]]
+ blake3 from [[https://github.com/pixel27/Blake3Hash.jl][Blake3Hash.jl]]

Note that this benchmark was run on a machine with AVX512, machines without
AVX512 (like the 13-14th gen Intel consumer CPUs), will experience a smaller
SIMD benefit.
