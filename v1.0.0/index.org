#+title: KangarooTwelve

* Background

A pure-Julia implementation of the [[https://keccak.team/kangarootwelve.html][KangarooTwelve]] hashing scheme, so named
because it consists of 12 rounds of [[https://keccak.team/keccak.html][Keccak]] ([[https://keccak.team/turboshake.html][TurboSHAKE]]128) with kangaroo
hopping, allowing for parallel [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree][tree]]-ish hashing termed "leaves stapled to a pole".

This scheme presents a particularly good balance of:
+ Simplicity (Keccak + sponge + hopping)
+ Security (128-bit)
+ Speed (up to ~2bytes/cycle)

It is currently an [[https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-irtf-cfrg-kangarootwelve/][IETF draft]].
