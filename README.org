A pure-Julia implementation of the [[https://keccak.team/kangarootwelve.html][KangarooTwelve]] hashing scheme, so named
because it consists of 12 rounds of [[https://keccak.team/keccak.html][Keccak]] ([[https://keccak.team/turboshake.html][TurboSHAKE]]128) with kangaroo
hopping, allowing for parallel [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree][tree]]-ish hashing termed "leaves stapled to a pole".

This scheme presents a particularly good balance of:
+ Simplicity (Keccak + sponge + hopping)
+ Security (128-bit)
+ Speed (up to ~2bytes/cycle)

It is currently an [[https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-irtf-cfrg-kangarootwelve/][IETF draft]].

* The Keccak-p permutation

There are some lovely figures elucidating the Keccak algorithm in [[https://keccak.team/files/Keccak-reference-3.0.pdf][the reference]],
which I'll pull out.

This is a variable-round permutation, with up to 24 rounds. The last round
performed matches the final Keccak-f permutation round.

Each round of permutation consists of five stages, termed \theta, \rho, \pi, \chi, and \iota.
These all operate on a 200-byte block.

** \theta step

Compute the parity of five columns, and xor-diffuse the parity into nearby columns.

** \rho step

Bitwise-rotate each of the 25-lanes by a different triangular number.

** \pi step

Permute each lane in a fixed pattern.

** \chi step

Intra-row bitwise combination, this provides the non-linearity.

** \iota step

The first lane is (xor-)mixed with a LSFR sequence across rounds. This serves to
disrupt the symmetry of the scheme.

* Sponge
